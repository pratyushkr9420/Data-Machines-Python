If you ever have a group of functions that work on the same data, that is a clue that a class can help you. Take a look at the following code. It demonstrates a simple way to calculate the GPA for a student's classes.\n","\n","\n","\n","```\n","def update_name(data):\n","   pass\n","\n","def calculate_gpa(data):\n","   pass\n","\n","def show_classes(data):\n","   pass\n","\n","def build_data():\n","   return {'classes': [{'name': 'info', 'credits':3, 'type': 'fun', 'grade':90.00},\n","                       {'name': 'econ 101', 'credits':4, 'type': ' not fun', 'grade':80.00}]}\n","\n","data= build_data()\n","update_name(data, 'info', 'mh2')\n","calculate_gpa(data)\n","show_classes(data)\n","```\n","\n","###**Family of functions**\n","\n","In the above code, you have a group of functions that all work on the same data. This is a classic case where using a class would be better. Why? All those functions work on the same type of data (it's been passed in as a parameter). Sometimes you see similar code, but work on, gasp , global data. In any case, it's hard to manage those functions as you need to always remember that they 'belong' together. If the structure of the data changes, you would have to remember to update the corresponding functions.\n","\n","###**Architecting a multiple component solution**\n","\n","Another case for using classes is when you need to model a solution that involves different parts or components. For example, if you were building a text analysis engine , you might want to use a class to represent the text, a class to manage building the text class from data, and different classes to manage algorithms to work on that text. The class architecture helps you keep a separation of concerns and build code that can be de-coupled (to some point).\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"332spu2l1Dqn"},"source":["#**Building Classes**\n","The standard way in Python is put similar functions in the same file (called a module or library).\n","\n","The functions in the same file/module/library usually have some unifying purpose. Classes are done similarly. You put a class in a file and call that a module. Modules can have more than one class in them. But the standard practice is to have one public class per module. The word public in this context is referring to how you want others to use your class. The public classes are the ones available for others to use. Some classes can be considered private or protected as well -- definitions we will get to later.\n","\n","\n",">  **Coder's Log:** The word package usually refers to a collection of modules. A module is a single file of python code that can be imported.\n","\n","\n","\n","#**Class Syntax**\n","Much like creating a function in Python, creating a class involves using a few special keywords.

It is optional and we will discuss it in a later lesson. But the Point2D class can do everything the object class can do.\n","* the **:** marks the start of the class implementation\n","\n","def \\__init__(self, xp, yp): \n","* the keyword def is used just like for defining functions.\n","* the name \\__init__ is reserved for classes. The init method (method is the name of a function inside a class) gets called when you create a new object (i.e. an instance of the class). It is called the **constructor method**.\n","* the double underscores __ around the name init signal to the reader that the function is 'private'.

The self argument refers to the **specific instance of the class**. All other parameters after the self argument can be given any valid Python variable name. In this case both xp and yp are just the names of the formal parameters.\n","\n","\n","###**An important note about respecting privacy**\n","\n","Those who use your code (including the author -- you), should never call methods that begin with an _ (single or double) outside of the class code. Python won't enforce it, but you will announce to the world that you do not care about conventions, best practices, and building robust code.\n","\n","self.x = xp\n","* this sets the internal variable x (meant to be managed only by the specific instance of Point2D) to the value held in the parameter xp\n","* self.y = yp does the same but with y and yp\n","* both x and y are called attributes (we'll see later how attributes become **properties**).\n","\n","\n","###**An important note to self**\n","\n","The keyword ***self*** is used to refer to the specific memory location where the instance is living. It can only be used inside the class. Other languages use this to denote the same thing.
